# Formatting
- Stick to a common set of style rules
- **Getting it to work isn't the first concern!** Code style and readability will affect the code long after the original has been changed.
- **Style and discipline survives even if your code doesn't**
- Try and keep files between 200 and 500 lines
- **Vertical Formatting** - High to low-level, separate groups of related lines by a blank line, tightly-related code should be vertically dense
- Concepts closely related should be kept vertically close 
- Vertical distance between concepts should be a measure of how important each is to understanding the other
- Declare variables as close to their usage as possible
- Short functions should have all variables declared at top
- Declare instance variables at the top of classes
- Caller functions should be above their callees (ideally). *This gives the program a natural flow.*
- Low-level functions should come last 
- Keep lines short (~120 characters)
- Use horizontal whitespace to associate strongly related things
