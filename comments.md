# Comments
- Comments are for compensating for our lack of ability to express ourselves in code
- Comments are hard to maintain, think hard before you add some
- **Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments**. Set expectations that will never be filled, lay down rules that need not and should not be followed.
- Write a function that describes the same thing that a would-be comment would
- There are a few types of acceptable comments
- **Legal Comments** - Copyright, author statements 
- **Informative Comments** - Provide basic information or context to make something easier to understand
- **Explanation of Intent** - Used for explaining a decision
- **Clarification** - Useful for clarifying obscure concepts; good for use with standard libraries or code you can't modify
- **Warning of Consequences** - Warn a future engineer about something
- **TODO Comments** - Useful for marking something that should be done but that you may not have time to finish now. NOT an excuse to leave bad code.
- **Amplification** - Used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential
- Bad types of comments include mumbling, redundant, misleading, mandated, journal, and noise comments
- It's silly to mandate that every function have a documenting comment. Not only will this clutter your code but it is just another thing to keep updated.
- **Don't leave commented out code.** Others will be confused and afraid to remove it.
- Only include local information in your comments. You can't depend on global information staying the same.
- Connection between the code and it's comment should be obvious
- **Comments shouldn't need their own explanation**
- A good function name is usually better than a comment header
- Generated documentation for internal functions is generally not useful
- Comments can be used to ease a reader into a complicated routine
